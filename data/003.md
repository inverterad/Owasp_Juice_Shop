## SQL Injection - Bypass login

Let's try and get into the admin account, first I needed to find out the e-mail so I clicked around and found a review.

![admin review](<../images/2026-02-06 - adminreview.png>)

Now armed with the e-mail I try commenting away the password with a couple of simple extra characters.

    admin@juice-sh.op'-- 

![admin login](<../images/2026-02-06 - adminlogin.png>)

And it was a success.

![admin logged in](<../images/2026-02-06 - adminloggedin.png>)

A short summary of SQL injections

Using SQL Injection a threat actor breaks out of the intended user input context to inject SQL code into a database query. The injected code can modify the query in a way to alter what information is being collected and shown. Or it could bypass steps in the query to make a login query skip the password requirement altogether.
