## Weak Credentials

I discovered that the OWASP Juice Shop allows weak passwords.

And through publishing the login name, in this case e-mail, very publicly they allow for antagonists to easily find an attack vector.

I actually guessed the password for the admin@juice-sh.op account.

A short summary of the problem and possible solutions.

Allowing for weak passwords from an application like this enables guessing and brute-force attacks. You want a password policy that is hard to guess and takes a long time to brute-force and possibly some form of two factor authentication and IP/account lockdown after too many failed attempts.
