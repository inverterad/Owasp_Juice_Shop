## DOM-based XSS injection - My first exploit

I decided to start easy and try out the DOM-based XSS injection, this was simply done by typing 
    
    <iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">

into the search bar. It was a success.

A short summary of DOM-based XSS injections

With user input it is possible to inject harmful code into the webpage and make the webpage to execute it as code.
This type of attack makes it possible to steal session tokens, user data etc from a legitimate user. With said tokens the attacker can hijack a session and basically become the user without ever needing their password. A harmful DOM-based XSS injection attack is most likely done through phishing where they inbed the injection into a hyperlink that is then sent to the victim.
