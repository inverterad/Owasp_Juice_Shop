## Initial enumeration

The first thing I want to test is Gobuster, and immediately I get an error.

This means that OWASP returns a 200 ok for everything, even if it's missing. So I have to tweak some stuff to get around this problem.

    curl -i http://host.docker.internal:3000

I get the response that content length is 75055, so I'll exclude this in my next run of Gobuster.

    gobuster dir -u http://host.docker.internal:3000 -w /usr/share/wordlists/common.txt --exclude-length 75055

We found quite a few interesting things.

Now I should probably just use Burp and look around to begin with.

It was all a mess for a good while, I followed the instructions and looked at the main.js code and found it all confusing. So I went the other direction and "guessed" some URL:s, since I had done the gobuster search I checked out robots.txt and then security.txt which led me to the scoreboard.

Afterwards I did find the relevant part of the js-code, I believe. And a few other interesting paths to check out later.
